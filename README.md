# Hi guys üëã, I created this following the guide provided by **[random meal generator](https://tinyurl.com/random-meal)** - Florin Pop as part of the #100Days100Projects and made it my own.

# Hope you enjoy, as I had fun with the Javascript. üòÅ

I used html to create the top section along with a button. Once the button is clicked, a random meal is generated by an external api (themealdb) and this generates a random meal, if you don't want the meal that's displayed, you can click on the button again to repeat the proccess and generate another random meal.

I used a for loop to iterate through the ingredients and a if statement that verifies that the logic is met for the for loop. The ingredients then get mapped and joined together when they're found in order for them to be displayed in html.
